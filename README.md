## Rasa Chatbot Demo
This is a demo of a chatbot I built using Rasa framework.
To showcase the chatbot, I created a simple HTML page that simulates an interaction. It includes a chat-style interface and screenshots of real conversations of how this bot works.

### What This Project Is About
This chatbot was designed as part of my work in Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI. It handles basic interactions in language learning and demonstrates how intent recognition and dialogue management work in Rasa.

### Whatâ€™s in the Demo

- A mock chat interface built with HTML and CSS
- Screenshots of sample conversations with the bot
- A simple, scrollable layout that walks you through the interaction
- To try it out, just open this link https://thecognicode.github.io/rasa_chatbot_demo/

### Built with:
- Rasa - for NLU and dialogue management
- HTML + CSS - for the visual chat-style demo
- Screenshots - to show how the bot works
